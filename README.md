## Setup

This site is deployed on [GithubPages]()

If you would like to look at the code itself or run our test suites:
  1. Clone down this repo with  `git clone https://github.com/travel-tracker.git[what you want to name the repo]`
  2. Change into the directory and run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
  3. Run `open src/index.html` in the terminal to see the HTML page (you should see some boilerplate HTML displayed on the page)
  4. Run ```npm test [name of the test you want to run]``` to see our tests for any of the Class js files.
  **Note that you will need the [WebpackStarterKit](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/webpack-starter-kit) to see it in action**

## Future Iterations

- Agent interaction as outlined in Iteration 4 of the spec
- More responsiveness and animations in the design

## Wins

- Accesibility score in Lighthouse remains at 100 after Iteration 3

- Functionality seems to be working and the design is responsive with media queries, keeping in mind both mobile and web devices
- GET and POST appears to work well
- All tests for classes have passed

## Challenges

- Time constraints made it difficult to implement my original hopes for UX in expanding and contracting sections
- Date functionality was more difficult to work through than expected
